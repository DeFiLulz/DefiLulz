##  About Me

I’m **DefiLulz** — a full-stack blockchain builder, DeFi degen, **Web3 researcher**, smart contract architect, and tokenomics experimenter.

I operate at the edge of:
- ⛓️ Ethereum's security  
- ⚡ Solana's speed  
- 🔭 Layer 2 scalability  
- 💰 DeFi yield design  
- 🧠 DAO coordination  

I don’t just write code — I encode trust, incentives, and freedom into composable protocols.

##  Tech Stack

| 💡 Languages | 🧪 Tooling | 🪐 Domains |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Solidity • JavaScript • Rust • Python | Hardhat • Foundry • Anchor • Solana CLI • Ethers.js • Chainlink • IPFS | DeFi • DAOs • Tokenomics • NFTs • ZK • RWAs |

I build with both **EVM** and **Solana** ecosystems in mind — bridging UX with infra, speed with security.

##  Areas of Play

- 🧱 Yield vaults & staking logic  
- 🛠️ Smart contract optimization (EVM + Solana)  
- 🧠 DAO tooling, voting systems, and treasury flows  
- 🧬 ZK tech & L2 experimentation  
- 🌐 Web3 frontends & wallet integrations

##  Ethos

> "Own your keys. Own your data. Own your destiny."

I believe in:
- 🪙 Tokenized access to everything  
- 📜 Governance you can fork  
- 🕸️ Composability as a design principle  
- 🚀 Fast chains with meaningful decentralization  
- 📊 Open-source by default

---

##  Fun Facts

- I've broken more smart contracts than I’ve launched (on testnets).  
- I track wallets the way others follow influencers.  
- I sleep when gas is low and Solana’s not forking.  
- I believe memes, bridges, and validators all deserve respect.
